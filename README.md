**FLIGHT FARE PREDICTION**

*Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, and it will be a different story.*

Following is the description of features available in the dataset â€“
1. Airline: The name of the airline.
2. Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey
3. Source: The source from which the service begins.
4. Destination: The destination where the service ends.
5. Route: The route taken by the flight to reach the destination.
6. Dep_Time: The time when the journey starts from the source.
7. Arrival_Time: Time of arrival at the destination.
8. Duration: Total duration of the flight.
9. Total_Stops: Total stops between the source and destination.
10. Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight
11. Price: The price of the ticket

In order to solve the above problem I have created a Predicitive model and further developed an application where we can get *Flight Ticket Prices*

I have built this model using the Machine learning algorithm i.e

**Random forest regressor and deployed using Flask**


**USER INTERFACE**

User can give the required inputs and it predicts the ticket price.
